1.For Dinosauria there are 8349 unique reference numbers in the data extracted from Paleobiology Database
2. For Canidae there are 1489 unique reference numbers in the data extracted from Paleobiology Database
3. For Hominoidea there are 374 unique reference numbers in the data extracted from Paleobiology Database

final shell command used to extract relevant reference numbers was : 
cut -d "," -f 17 Hominoidea.csv | tail -n +18 | uniq | wc -l

I used the cut command to cut along the comma-seperated values in the file(csv file) and then took the 17th column which contained the reference numbers for the species.
I used the tail command to ignore the first 18 lines which was just additional information like the url. After that I used the uniq command to filter out the repeated reference
numbers and obtained the count of this final list by using the wc -l command.

1. For Dinosauria there are 2893 unique species in the data set. 

To extract this number I used:
tail -n +18 Dinosauria.csv |cut -d "," -f 1-6,8-17 |grep "species"|cut -d "," -f 9|sort |uniq |wc -l 
assuming that I should use the accpeted_rank to determine if the ranking actually went all the way down to the species level(based of Gaurav's suggestion). Since identified rank was causing 
problems with me using grep, the first thing I did was cut out that column. With the new data set minus the identidfied_rank column I searched for the species 
with the identified_rank of species. Based of that I cut the species_name coulmn and sorted it so I could get the unique value count of unique familes.
