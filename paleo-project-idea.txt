1.For Dinosauria there are 8349 unique reference numbers in the data extracted from Paleobiology Database
2. For Canidae there are 1489 unique reference numbers in the data extracted from Paleobiology Database
3. For Hominoidea there are 374 unique reference numbers in the data extracted from Paleobiology Database

final shell command used to extract relevant reference numbers was : 
cut -d "," -f 17 Hominoidea.csv | tail -n +18 | uniq | wc -l

I used the cutcommand to cut along the comma-seperated values in the file(csv file) and then took the 17th column which contained the reference numbers for the species.
I used the tail command to ignore the first 18 lines which was just additional information like the url. After that I used the uniq command to filter out the repeated reference
numbers and obtained the count of this final list by using the wc -l command.
