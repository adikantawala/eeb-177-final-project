    "# Intro\n",
    "For my project I decided to go with the paleo database. For my clade I decided to go with dinosaurs since I have been interested in dinosaurs since I was a lot younger and watched Jurassic Park. However, I realized that I do not know much about the evolutionary history of dinosaurus and thought it would be fascinating to learn more about it. For my project ideas I decided to to go with attempting to plot the diversity of a few of my genera though time and something that would give me a wider picture overall such as plotting the stratigraphic records of genera in my data set. The exact evolutionary orgin and timing is unkown but believed to be between 231 and 243 million years ago (Alcober). Dinosaurs were most dominant during the Jurassic and Cretaceous period and went extinct about 66 million years ago (Nesbitt). It will be interesting to see how my data and analysis matches up with this and if my data even reaches so far back. \n",
